                Obviously, I can’t deny that I spend a good amount of time on social media, scrolling through feeds and
                keeping
                up with what’s happening around me. But the internet is much more than just entertainment for me—it’s
                something
                I use constantly as a tool for learning and exploring. Whenever a question pops into my head, whether
                it’s big
                or small, I go online to search for answers. Sometimes that means Googling quick facts, other times it’s
                diving
                into articles, videos, or discussions to understand a subject better. I also rely a lot on ChatGPT to
                explain
                things, help me brainstorm, or guide me through topics I’m curious about. In a way, the internet has
                become my
                main resource for both knowledge and inspiration, not just for passing time.

            <p>I hope the internet keeps growing, but in a way that still feels personal and human. When I think about
                the web, I don’t just see it as a place for selling and advertising—I see it as a place where people can
                create, connect, and share pieces of themselves. The idea of the “handmade web” really inspires me
                because it reminds me that even in a world of AI and corporate platforms, we can still leave our own
                unique mark. For me, not everything online has to be loud or perfectly polished; I actually love the
                quieter corners of the internet, where you can stumble across someone’s personal project or small space
                they’ve made for others to enjoy. I want to build something like that myself—maybe a site where I share
                my work, or even a place where people can learn about the nature around them, like the plants and
                animals in California. To me, that’s what makes the web meaningful: it’s not just endless content, but
                rooms and shelves created by people for others to discover. My hope is that this kind of online
                community will always exist and keep growing.</p>
